While Calvin's real job has always been in computer science, he's nevertheless served as a de facto travel consultant for his friends, having visited more than a dozen countries across four continents. For over a decade, Calvin has had the fortune of working with great people in various areas of computer science: computer vision and image retrieval at Yale and MIT, music database analysis at Stanford, data mining at Microsoft, and image search at Google. After leaving Google, Calvin founded OpTrip (now part of Room 77), where his team built a next-generation travel planning engine -- a perfect combination of his passion in both travel and computer science."},"Ch":{"name":"Christine Chang","short_name":"Christine","pts":[],"role":"Financial Controller","languages":["eng"],"countries":[],"eng":{"lang":"","editor":""},"filters":["business"],"quote":"","detailed_info":""},"Dd":{"name":"Daniel Dobrott","short_name":"Danny","pts":[],"role":"Manager of Customer Service","languages":["eng"],"countries":["CA","FR","HK","IE","IT","MX","NL","ES","UK"],"eng":{"lang":"","editor":""},"filters":["business"],"quote":"","detailed_info":""},"Do":{"name":"Doug Aley","short_name":"Doug","pts":[],"role":"Product Manager","languages":["eng"],"countries":[],"eng":{"lang":"","editor":""},"filters":["product","alcohol","nature"],"quote":"","detailed_info":""},"Dr":{"name":"Drew Patterson","short_name":"Drew","pts":[],"role":"CEO","languages":["eng"],"countries":["DE","CH","FR","GB","ES","NL","IS","BE","CN","RU","KR","TR","JP","IN","GR","IT","HR","PT","CZ","SG","CA","MX","MA","EG","TZ","IL","CR","AR","BR","KE"],"eng":{"lang":"","editor":""},"filters":["baller","business","alcohol"],"quote":"","detailed_info":""},"Ho":{"name":"Holman Gao","short_name":"Holman","pts":[[6,10]],"role":"Software Engineer","languages":["eng","cmn","spa"],"countries":["CN","DO","UG","NL","CA","GT"],"eng":{"lang":"OCaml","editor":"Vim"},"filters":["eng","baller","music","nature"],"quote":"I like my box.","detailed_info":""},"Ia":{"name":"Ian Webster","short_name":"Ian","pts":[[2,10]],"role":"Software Engineer","languages":["eng","can","lat","swa"],"countries":["IS","HK","CR","FR","DE","JP","TC","NO","CA","BS"],"eng":{"lang":"javascript","editor":"Vim"},"filters":["eng","baller","music"],"quote":"Did someone say rap?
