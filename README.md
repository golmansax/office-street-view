Created in a hackathon.

Run `grunt server:dev` to get a local version running on port 8000.
Grunt compiles the repo into the `dist/` directory.

Run `grunt` to compile the source files.  You will need to run `bower update`
and `sudo npm install`, and you will need `php5`, `php5-cgi`, `php5-json`
packages.
